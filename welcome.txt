Hey, thanks for using my addon! 

To get started if you play anything other than rdruid you should double check that every spell you care about seeing on raidframes is 
showing. If anything is missing/broken/doesn't make sense just let me know and I'll change it. The discord for the addon is HasuitFrames, 
https://discord.gg/suzM65wjK8, or you can dm me at _dannycarry, or email HasuitFrames@gmail.com. I've pretty thoroughly tested everything 
that shows when playing rdruid, but other classes are mostly untested. This includes things like your own atonement showing on raidframes 
if you're on a disc priest, or the drs that show on arena frames. Those are also unique per class. example drs: if on a warlock you'll 
only be tracking stun fear and incap, and those will always show as Shadowfury, Fear, or Mortal Coil, regardless of what spell caused the 
DR (and they'll always be in the same dedicated spots per dr, stun first, fear 2nd, sheep third). So those are the kinds of things that 
might have problems, like if i made stun drs show as polymorph for warlock instead of shadowfury on accident, or if I forgot about tracking 
an important DR for a class (conflag root? etc). Those problems will be easy to fix as long as I know there's a problem. Also if you think 
a spec's hots would make more sense to prioritize differently or something let me know. I'm not very familiar with other classes' 
rotations and mostly just guessed what I thought the displays should look like based on looking through class spellbooks on tournament 
realm. 


Here's a link for the editmode profile I use if you want it. It's mostly just the classic preset with a few things changed. Also I don't 
use default actionbars at all except for one on the right of the screen for misc stuff. So anything about actionbars in this editmode 
profile should be ignored and you should revert those back to the way you had them. I use 1920x1080 resolution, if that matters here.

I recommend typing /hf or /hasuitframes in-game and running test functions for different group/arena sizes and seeing if you need to move 
anything. To do this, click a text box in the /hf menu next to Test Size, optionally change the number in the box, and hit enter. 
If needed, you can end a test by changing the number to 0 and hitting enter. 
You should probably move your castbar down to make it not overlap raid frames if groupsize>6, but depends on your setup. The raid frames 
probably won't be very nice to try to position things if you use several action bars at the bottom of the screen. I could come up with a 
better solution for that if that's a big problem for people, but I also think centered raidframes below player is just the best place to 
show them and it's worth moving some things around to get that. Let me know if you disagree/can't find a good way to position things and 
I'll work on an option for fitting raidframes into the bottom left or something like that. Worst case right now is you could just shove 
the raid frames off-screen and use whatever you were using before, and just use my addon for party/arena frames. Let me know if you 
do that though because I don't want my addon to be wasting your computer's resources on things it isn't being used for. You could also 
turn the addon off in areas you don't want it, but not ideal. 

There's a second page with more options you can go to to the left of the close button, but options for moving/positioning/sizing are kind 
of limited for now until I work on them more. 





A couple less obvious features: 

You can target frames with macros. /click d1-1 will target player, /click d2-1 will target party1 etc or the raid unit in that position 
if in a raid with <6 people but groups are split up. /click d2-1 will also target column 2 row 1 in a raid, so the frame immediately to 
the right of player's raid frame. The addon supports keybinding up to 20 raidframes this way. 5 columns/4 rows (let me know if anyone wants 
more). I personally have 1-5 bound to target row 1, shift 1-5 for row 2, alt-shift 1-5 for row 3, and ctrl 1-5 for row 4. It's just as 
natural as clicking the frames after a while. But ya you don't need everything bound. Just having a few can be very helpful like whatever 
you use to target party 1-4 in smaller groups. If you have target/focus arena macros those can be used to target friendly frames in raids. 
shift 1-5 and ctrl 1-5 are focus/target arena 1-5 for me as well as target raid. 

My macros look like this: (if re-using arena binds you'll want   /stopmacro [@raid6,exists]   so it won't change focus in bgs)

/click d2-2
/stopmacro [@raid6,exists]
/focus [@arena2]

That macro targets friendly column2, row2 in a raid, and focuses arena2 in arena. 

Macros for targeting arena frames are just plain old /tar [@arena1] etc. 
There will be an option in the future to always sort healer on top of arenaframes, but low on the list of priorities for now. 



You can move the camera/player by clicking through the raidframes. I'm still experimenting with this but it seems good. It gives you more 
mobility when clicking frames by letting you move through frames instead of constantly flinging the cursor around every time you want to 
target someone and/or move player or camera. More options will be added for this in the future, like disabling targeting and only relying 
on mouseover for certain groupsize/instance type (for pve?), but I need to work on it to allow mouse buttons like button5 to be usable as 
a mouseover bind at all. The only small downside here is you can't (only) turn the camera. Left click will act like a right click as far 
as turning the actual player with the camera and not just turning the camera. Still seems really good though, especially for a mouseover-
only gamer, when that option gets made. 





Let me know what you think or if you have any questions, or especially if you have any problems, either HasuitFrames discord, 
https://discord.gg/suzM65wjK8, or dm me _dannycarry. Or email HasuitFrames@gmail.com. I'm curious what people will think about different 
things, like the colored backgrounds in groupsize 4+ (by default). 

Basically everything I've written here has been about raids but don't be mislead by that. The majority of time and effort put into the 
addon has gone into arena. I've just also put a lot of effort into other areas of the game because I want the addon to cover everything, and 
it was relatively easy to make things for bgs/pve after I made similar things/systems for arena (minus some of the big things like colored 
backgrounds for raids which was a lot of extra work, but that was just too good to not make). 

Some important future updates: 
-Full nameplate replacement (with an option to disable) 
-Pet frames 
-Options to change size of frames/icons/castbars and options to grow raidframes in different directions/change number of columns etc 
-Audio warnings for some things (with an option to disable) 
-Option to show fewer abilities to make things less chaotic and more focused on things that matter the most, but disabled by default 
-Customization through personal addon along with guides 
-Use inspected talents of friendly players to modify their cooldowns if cooldowns are showing 
-Ability to show certain auras if missing from each unit they're missing from, like motw if playing Druid (or important dots on arena frames 
possibly?) 
-Maybe an option to change all cvars/options for the default ui to what I think they should be, and something to remember what you had before 
the change/change it back 
-Custom keybinding addon to match more closely what my action bars look like right now/make things easy to switch between multiple of the same 
class/easy to change specs and save stuff/increase the macro limit significantly above 255 with a new technique for tww+. 

If you're curious there's a much bigger list of ideas I have for the addon or things I'm working on. It's something I've been using as I 
make things to keep a list of priorities and not forget about anything. This is a place to look if you want to know whether I have plans 
for adding something, or feel free to just message on Discord. 
It's in   addon idea list.txt

There's also a bunch of stuff I wrote below about customization. That has been more work than I expected but I've made a lot of progress 
toward it. I'm putting that off until later just because when I allow customization like that it'll be harder to make updates to the addon 
because I'll have to be careful to not break custom stuff that people make. The addon will eventually allow basically any customization you 
can think of, including custom scripts for anything, like custom icons, or custom places where icons go, or custom scripts interacting with 
unitFrames efficiently, or ways to disable things you don't like that don't have options in /hf

One final thing is if you decide not to use HasuitFrames, you should type /console scriptProfile 0 and hit enter in-game after removing the 
addon and reloading the game with the addon disabled. It won't make a huge difference but it should make the game just a little bit faster. 
No other addons use that for anything except what it's actually for, which is showing cpu usage per addon and other stuff like that, but mine 
relies on it for almost everything to work at all, for now. 

I hope you enjoy the addon.

COMING SOON (nothing anywhere below has been finished): 

(Coming soon) Alternatively to messaging about missing spells, you can use the template in HasuitFramesTemplate.lua and add everything 
yourself. Doing this can disable any spells from the main addon for the class/spec you're playing if you want it to, or you can disable 
specific ones, so you can have your own personalized setup. You'll be adding stuff in your own addon with functions from mine. The template 
has detailed instructions on how to make your own blank addon and how to get started adding custom stuff into my addon through it. The 
first thing there after showing how to make a blank addon is something simple you can copy paste and add spells to. 

(Coming soon) Below that is a description of how to customize things a bit more, like changing size or opacity of an icon, or how to track 
an icon in a different location. 

(Coming soon) I tried to make it easy to get everything set up and working well, even with no experience programming. 
Don't be afraid of using a text editor instead of a normal gui from an addon. I personally used default notepad++ (Windows 10) to make 
100% of the addon, so that's what I'd recommend, although I've also never tried anything else. ctrl-f find in files is extremely helpful 
to be able to find something across many files instead of ctrl-fing each one one at a time, (find in all opened documents is good too) 



(Coming soon) Guide for more advanced things like if you want to make your own functions or controllers and add spells with those, like 
making a new controller in the middle of the screen somewhere tracking enemy cooldown auras that are active (I have plans for adding audio 
warnings to the main addon for certain things like this in the future that will have an easy option to disable in /hf), or if there's some 
custom function you want to run every time the game sends a certain event for a spell, like changing the frame's border color if they have 
a magic debuff, or print something to chat when some event is seen. Pretty much anything will be possible. The guide will also show how to 
access certain parts of the addon's unit frame update functions from your external addon and efficiently run a custom function on every unit 
frame every time some condition changes, like once every time unitFrame width changes, or just every time they get updated at all. 

(Coming soon) Guide for adding or removing cooldowns, this should already be possible and pretty easy if you know how it works? Not 100% 
sure though. You could also create new cooldown controllers and put cooldowns somewhere new. 

(Coming soon) In-depth guide for how the addon works, as well as a full list of functions/variables, and intended ways of adding customization 
along with individual guides for those if needed. 

(Coming soon) And potentially new features that make more of the addon accessible from outside for more customization, let me know if you 
have ideas for things you'd want to do but the addon doesn't allow it. 



(Coming soon) The addon is like a motorcycle. As Terry Davis said, if you lean over on a motorcycle, it crashes. If something breaks in my 
addon, even if it seems small, it can have cascading effects and quickly make the game unplayable. I like the motorcycle approach, but part 
of that is that people's personal addons are going to be putting things into shared arrays of functions and if there are any errors the rest 
of the array and anything after will get canceled. If that becomes a problem I have an easy backup plan of updating the addon and 
temporarily(tm) pcalling everything that might be shared with an external addon, and then working on making a new system of only pcalling 
things that were added from outside just to be a bit more efficient. 

(Coming soon) With all that being said, I hope to eventually get everything made 100% so that no customization is needed, and I also want 
to get to a point where this is the only addon needed to be downloaded to play the game competitively, but that's in the future. 











(Coming soon) Why this setup instead of the normal way of doing everything in-game?: 
It's much more freeing using a text editor instead, and saves a lot of effort from me and also saves computer resources. 
Creating everything from savedvariables, especially custom functions, is pretty inefficient and an ugly way of doing it in my opinion. 
Copy pasting 20 spells directly into an addon at the same time can be nice compared to slowly copy pasting one at a time and hitting enter, 
or just putting down a random function you want to have or run something whenever. You could make something quickly that might not even be 
related to my addon if you want. There's no limitation on anything whatsoever like there is in any addon's gui. (except locals that might 
not be accessible from outside, which I plan on reducing) This way you can also build up knowledge incrementally over time and be able to 
make more and better things. Not to mention you could create 10x more custom stuff than the addon currently has and block out the sun with 
ui and not come close to lagging, even in 40man raids. 

(Coming soon) downsides I can think of: 
Harder to visualize what you're doing and what options might be available (there will be guides though) 
Extra step for sharing things of getting everyone to open a text editor and copy paste into their unique addon somewhere, although for 
this default notepad would be fine? People might share entire addons they made, which is fine and probably a good way of doing it, but 
that could lead to addon spam in the addon list (talking about you dbm). Hopefully people will put HasuitFrames as the beginning of the 
name for any addon they make related to it at least. No enforcement of using the correct values for things. Someone could try to track 
a spell with an existing hasuitSpellFunction_ but put a number in the spellOptions table for something instead of a string and they'd 
only find out later, possibly causing errors. Not an inherent problem here but easier to check for the other way.
