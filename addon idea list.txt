player buffs/debuffs showing for specs that haven't been set up like spriest dots on arena frames, buffs on allies from player, more important for friendly buffs
middle cast bars
display for spellcasts and who they're from for people with ranged kicks like shaman
make party interrupt display for m+
display for purgable buffs for people that have purge
pet frames
make click through frames good to use like probably needs to have both left and right click target a unit so that either can be used depending on whether player wants camera move or player move, also option to disable both and only use mouseover, and option to just have normal frames. i think click through could be cool in raids for more mobility/less flinging cursor above raid frames to control movement but never got it to work before this so no experience. need to keep right click as focus on arena frames. small bonus to the click through stuff is can't accidentally click a frame and get prevented from turning. ages ago i tried to set things up so that everything that didn't have a reason to be clicked would ignore mouse clicks for this reason, although not sure if i've accidentally clicked anything but some stupid nameplate icons or the new popup saying the instance name or whatever. also todo make sure those are propagated through as much as possible. those are actually important to make less annoying
also way to use mouse buttons like button4/button5 on unitframes like normal keybinds is necessary for using mouseover binds

less important:
audio warnings for things or some way of knowing when offensive cds get pressed at least without needing to rely on another addon
efficient target indicator for bgs
nameplates, especially important for melee
drs/cc break cds like pvp trinket on nameplates for bgs
maybe mostly show important external cds from healers? instead of defensives, not sure what would be better to see as a dps
option for enemy healer on position 1 and some kind of easy macro solution to replace @arena1/@arenax, this would make a pretty big impact when there are multiple of one class and be good in general
use talent info from inspecting to change friendly cds, i made this before in prototype cd addon and not that hard especially since the addon already inspects people, but will be a lot of work collecting all the relevant talent data and not sure how much effort it'll take to integrate this with existing setup/leaving arena frames the way they are
aura missing function for motw/fort
loss of control auras in pve although now i don't think there's a good way to tell what these are without tracking each one manually. at least make something to show cc on player, actually use that to tell which spellids are cc? and add manually to the addon after seen so that it will show right before it goes on player. there's a way to tell player is cced by random pve buff isn't there?
option to disable all in pve or whatever
track healer dispel cds

even less important:
summon/rez/phase indicators
tooltip on mouseover frame?
option to hide cooldowns from player
figure out why arena spec icons break and don't show up sometimes
Restitution
Seasoned Winds
unit_in_range onevents now that it's registered to each unitframe anyway
remove delay on unit update event like rosterupdate and make more unit events instead of registering them for all units. or something, not 100% sure how the game expects things to be handled if like a maxhealth event happens for a unit and rosterupdate happens at the same time. like what order does that happen in? have to assume if i remove the delay on rosterupdate those will always match correctly. that delay was probably the source of some problems
get rid of extra max health/color check on roster update if the delay was the reason it was needed. not sure. think that might have been a problem even when there was no delay

might want to do a pretty big rework of unit events, maybe make most of them similar to unit_health system and do an extra check for everything any time a unitguid's (main as in the one addon registers unit events for) unit token gets changed. that way could keep the useful delay and never have to worry about it causing problems. i'll test exactly how the order for things work but i think this might end up being the best way to do unit events/roster updates. (i think unit events can happen on the same gettime as roster update but roster update always happens toward the end of events for current gettime, making me wonder if events can happen for a unit and then that unit changes to something else on the same gettime. i know it's capped to one per gettime like a unit's unit_health). currently the addon gets carried by unit_aura fullupdates and a check in the addon's function for that whether unitguid matches
dr system should be remade to be less awful to work with and made more similar to other icons, probably not given their own dedicated spots for an entire arena but not sure
could improve drs to be more accurate too and not give incorrect border color sometimes if cc hits right on the edge of dr timer like at 18.6 sec, drs are rng for a small window there (i think) and current system doesn't consider that. should also test how that works in tww, might not even be rng anymore who knows
whole loading sequence should be looked at. initialize should just put stuff into unloaded table, then run all loadon checks/class specific checks and decide whether to load or even just remove completely during playerlogin, also decide whether options[1] function should care about ignoring player or not here. can save a little bit of performance skipping the is or is not player checks for spells that player can't cast anyway

get rid of the gap that can happen if arena1/3 are targeting something but not arena2, maybe do something to make lines more distinct if a class is targeting their same class

make color check function more specific and not based on 5 different functions like unit_flags assuming anything can indicate d/c or reconnect? although that might just be the best way to do it

Recompense sac damage on next judgement, has points, not sure how/where to show it exactly but can be big

clean up some naming like frame should become unitframe, everything gets a clear and unique name, so no self





older notes:

learning mode that will record games and be able to play them back later with mouseover tooltip info --maybe big project but could be cool and useful

world pvp fake party/arena frames


kicking penance doesn't make it show kicked, like that for all channels?


figure out if there's stuff that can be based on some kind of server tick? I saw a rogue and druid stealth at a full second apart but they got unseen at the exact same time. seemed like they were visible up until the unseen event 
too, running around in stealth across the map even though their nameplates had disappeared. possible to predict dr timers better from something like this? is pinging them in stealth useful at all?

different border color on nameplates if they're in clone range?

maybe have dedicated info frames for people/the arena somewhere out of the way that shows specs and health numbers and stuff? maybe out of combat or while gates are up


targetexact name for buttons instead of unit? with some kind of exception for multiple of one name existing. might make it so when people leave there's no need to re-sort even though the units go crazy? and might make world pvp frames permanent even 
if the unit disappears, and estimate health based on combat log. could be especially good for bg frames if those get made

different look for soft target nameplates?

spell_cast_failed used to detect whether barkskin didn't work because of a disorient? maybe too much like addon is playing the game

ability for an icon to take up space and position as if it had a different size than it actually does, could be nice for things like a cast turning into an INC?

track strongest instant cast available from healers/next available to know if worth leaving a gap in cc?

make cds smaller the fewer charges they have?

always show minimum 1 dot debuff on a target if there are any? even if weak

alt-ctrl-shift-right click to put a green 2nd border around arena frame or something and hide buff missing, like the red icon idea for debuff missing topleft of frame, if strat is to not dot that target or something after aura missing system gets made? could be actually useful for shuffle/nocomms games if that makes it that way for other people using the addon although would probably never get used by more than 1% or fewer of players
the better idea with alt-ctrl-shift-right clicking a frame is to give a frame/frames higher priority so for example you know it's you and 2 other dps going to mines at the start of ab, make both of those frames higher priority so it shows you, important dps1, important dps2 all together at the top and way more easy for people to target them with binds if they only have target 1-3 bound instead of full target raid1-10 or raid1-20
this was really good in av classic when i had that set up in vuhdo, me claudio and gum first 3 raidframes and then the 37 others like normal, this will 100% get added as a feature eventually, not sure about the one for arena frames

bigger lines if unit has offensive cds up? or a border or something, maybe not

reflected spell incs?


cooldown text color changing color over time as it gets closer to being back up? instead of the fixed colors at 19/5 seconds

should have an option to only show timer text on specific icons below a set amount like 4 sec, would be nice for keeping up buffs/debuffs like rejuv or other things

do something with border cooldown tech on certain icons to help show exactly when the effect will end without needing to have timer text?

prevent auras from getting full update temporarily right after they press a stealth ability?

make a function for cd reset for ice block/shifting power/hypo that checks whether it got reduced below the icon adjacent to it and sort if it did

could have a bar over party cc with own dispel cd if it can be dispeled
one problem with limiting the number of cooldowns visible is the greyed out icons that will never get seen on most specs with current setup


EditModeManagerFrame:AreRaidFramesForcedShown()
EditModeManagerFrame:ArePartyFramesForcedShown()
if party isn't set to use raid frames in the default ui events completely break down in shuffle, need to make a check for that and a note when changing it for people --not true anymore? this was part of the tww beta incident

could have text on frames in shuffle showing who swapped sides or text showing rating or win/loss in current lobby

defensive cooldowns hide unless <30 seconds left?

show berserker rage cd somehow on feared warriors to know whether they can break it themselves?

sigil of misery inc?

some kind of timer for ring of frost ticks? could help swap clone at the exact right time for ring of frost to freeze someone if it's already active on top of someone but got immuned, or could help time travel form leaps out of ring? if it works like that

time the difference between server's trinket cd and a normal one based on cleu, could learn something/get a more accurate offset than 0.167, if it varies then could that tell something about server tick rate? idk if that's really a thing or if it's consistent at all. don't think it is

does shifting power reset cs if it's on cd from polymorph getting kicked?

track will of the forsaken differently for group? ideally only if it's relevant so against anything with fear etc

timers for d/ced people counting how long they're offline

keep track of what health a mage altered at? or probably too much


cooldown text color could signify something like green is always hard cc etc?


how do onupdate functions get prioritized? will certain frames always come before others or is it based on setscript time?
